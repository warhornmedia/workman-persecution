#### Text Status {-}

0. **Current status:** --> Unstarted - Empty project files created, but that's it.
1. Rough - Metadata entered, computer-generated text from scans entered. Unstructured, and likely to include many errors.
2. Cleaned - Text has been structured, footnotes and endnotes linked, and extra line-breaks, hyphens, page numbers and other artifacts removed.
3. Complete - Carefully proofed, including any foreign language quotes, footnotes, and endnotes. 

#### Editorial Notes {-}

1. Headings: Structuring this book for easier browsing required adding titles to various sections. Any heading text in [brackets] was added in the editing process. 
2. If you're reading this, you can't trust the editorial notes. ;)
